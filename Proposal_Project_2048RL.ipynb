    "\n",
    "This project attempts to solve the game 2048 using reinforcement learning algorithms. The objective for the model is to achieve as high of a tile as possible without losing the game (i.e. getting a full grid with no allowable moves). The game can quantified as a $4x4$ matrix, with a fixed set of actions available at each state. The performance of the model can be measured by the score at the end of the game, which is accumulated at each move by adding the merged tile values. In addition, the setup of this game is replicable due to based on its stochasticity and the clearly defined environment."

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main evaluation metric that we will utilize in this project is the average score of the games $S_{mean}$. The average score $S_{mean}$ for a total of $N$ games with $a_i$ actions each is defined as:\n",
    "    $$S_{mean} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N S_i$$\n",
    "    $$\\text{where }S_i = \\sum_{k=1}^{a_i} \\text{merged tile values}$$\n",
    "In other words, the total score for a single game is calculated by summing the new tile values formed by merging at every action (according to the scoring formula given by 2048). The evaluation metric for a model is the average of this value over all $N$ simulated games.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this metric, we will also observe the distribution of maximum tile value achieved by the model over $N$ games as a more intuitive measure of the quality of the model. Note that this metric is directly correlated with the score as defined above. However, this would still be a interesting statistic to observe since it is a more direct measure in relation to the objective of the game, which is to get as high of a number as possible. For example, if two players both end the game with a 2048 maximum tile, the results can be considered as equal in practice despite potential differences in total scores."

The official 2048 game itself was created by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli and is a free and open-source software.
